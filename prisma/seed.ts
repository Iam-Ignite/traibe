## Why React?
- Component-based architecture
- Virtual DOM for better performance
- Large ecosystem and community
- Great developer experience

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.`,

## Core Principles:
1. **Consistency** - Use familiar UI patterns
2. **Hierarchy** - Guide users' attention
3. **Feedback** - Let users know what's happening
4. **Simplicity** - Remove unnecessary complexity
5. **Accessibility** - Design for everyone

These principles form the foundation of user-centered design.`,

## HTML
HTML provides the structure of web pages. It uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

## CSS
CSS is used to style and layout web pages. It controls colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and responsive design.

Together, they form the foundation that every web developer must master.`,

## Key Concepts:
- Variables and Data Types
- Functions
- Control Flow (if/else, loops)
- DOM Manipulation
- Events

Modern JavaScript (ES6+) has introduced powerful features like arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, and modules that make development more efficient.`,

## Common Hooks:
- **useState** - Add state to components
- **useEffect** - Perform side effects
- **useContext** - Access context values
- **useRef** - Create mutable references
- **useMemo** - Memoize expensive calculations
- **useCallback** - Memoize functions

Hooks revolutionized React development by making functional components as powerful as class components.`,
